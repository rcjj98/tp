### Project: HRConnect

progress of each applicant during the application process.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## Enhancements implemented

* **Edit Feature**: Added the ability to edit details of job applicants.
    * What it does: Allows the user to update any current details of job applicants that were added previously.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes when adding a new
      job applicant and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.

* **Export Feature**: Added the ability to export the data from the application to a csv file.
    * What it does: Allows the user to export all applicant data to a csv save file for archiving.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user's address book can start to fill up
      with contacts that are no longer important and the application should provide a convenient way to export data to a
      file to allow users the convenience of making a copy before clearing the data.
