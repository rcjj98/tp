### Project: HRConnect

This product is for tech HR recruiters who prefer to use CLI to store contacts of job applicants and their respective interviews as well as keep track of the status of each applicant through the application process.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature:** Added more flexibility to the `find` command.
  * What it does: Allows users to search of any data in their respective sections (Task/Interview/Applicant)
  using the flags as defined in the app. It also simulates 'AND' and 'OR' statements through the use of
  the `g/` flag.
  * Justification: The previous `find` command was too simplistic in the sense that
  it can only search for names. With more data fields being added to HRConnect, a
  stronger search function is required to enable users to effectively
  look for data that they are looking for. Furthermore, the simulation of 'AND' and 'OR' commands
  gives users more flexibility and control over their search criteria, leading to a better experience for the user.
  * Highlights: This enhancement improves upon the original `find` command. Hence, it requires some analysis into other design
  considerations to ensure that the enhancement is intuitive and useful to the user. It was also challenging to implement
  a custom `g/` flag for the `find` command as it requires custom validity checks which builds upon the 
  ArgumentTokenizer and ArgumentMultiMap.

* **New Feature:** Added an `import` feature to allow job applicants data to be transferred into the address book.
  * What it does: Allows users to import all job applicants data from a csv save file that was previously
  exported out by the `export` command.
  * Justification: This feature is complementary to the `export` command it allows previously exported data to be
  reintegrated back into the address book.
  * Highlights: This enhancement was challenging because of the fact that the csv save file can be 
  subjected to a lot of other changes by the user. A lot of checks is needed to ensure that the contents of the csv save file 
  contents adhere to the flag formats as defined in the HRConnect app. Furthermore, there is also a check for any duplicates
  within both the csv save file and the app itself before adding all the job applicants to the app.
