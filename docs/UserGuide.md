# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format regarding Features:**<br>

* Items in angle brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g n/NAME <p/PHONE_NUMBER> can be used as n/John Doe p/PHONE_NUMBER or as n/John Doe.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in add n/NAME, NAME is a parameter which can be used as add n/John Doe.

* Items with ellipsis (...) after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. <a/ADDRESS>... can be used as   (i.e. 0 times), a/ADDRESS, a/ADDRESS etc.

* Parameters can be supplied in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command requires n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER, <br> p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify p/12341234 p/56785678, only p/56785678 will be taken.

## General Features
----------

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format regarding General Features:**<br>

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (e.g. `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Viewing Help: `help`
Shows a message explaining how to access the help page and the basic flags.

Format: `help`

&nbsp;

### Exiting the program: `exit`
Exits the program.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Applicant Features
----------

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the Applicant List:**<br>

* Applicant list is sorted in order in which the applicant was added into the list.<br>
  e.g If Alex Tan was added before Alex Wong, Alex Tan would be listed before Alex Wong.

</div>

### Adding a new job applicant: `add [p]`
Adds a new job applicant to the HRConnect.

Format: `add [p] n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS j/JOB_POSITION s/STAGE`

* Duplicate applicants **cannot** be added. Applicants are considered to be duplicates if they share the **same name (case-insensitive)**. <br>
e.g. `Alex Tan` and `alex tan` are duplicate applicants.
* If the `NAME` input contain empty spaces, it will be trimmed and each applicant will be considered as a duplicate even if their names differ in the amount of empty spaces. Let `(space)` denote an empty space. <br>
e.g. `Alex(space)Tan` and `Alex(space)(space)Tan` are duplicate applicants. <br>
e.g. `Alex(space)Tan` and `AlexTan` are NOT duplicate applicants as `AlexTan` does not have any empty spaces.

* Interview list can contain interviews with date and time before the current date and time. <br>
  e.g. If current date time is 4 April 2022, interview list can still contain interview with date 30 March 2022.

## Storage
----------
### Saving the data
HRConnect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

&nbsp;
### Editing the data file
HRConnect data are saved as a JSON file `PATH_TO_JAR_FILE/data/HRConnect.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

:exclamation: **Caution:** If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, the HRConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. <br><br>
:exclamation: **Caution:** Manual modification of the JSON file is **NOT** a supported feature. Inconsistent data resulting from manual modification of the data file should **NOT** be considered as unexpected behaviour. <br>
Example: Manually editing the `NAME` of applicant in the applicant list of the data file but not on interview list will lead to inconsistent data vice versa and any unusual behaviour caused by this should **NOT** be seen as a bug.

&nbsp;
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Importing the data file: `import`

Imports all **job applicants** data from a *csv* save file generated from this HRConnect.

File structure for csv file (tab delimited):

name | phone number | email | address | job position | stage

Notes:
1. Filepath can be relative or absolute.
2. No duplicates are allowed to be imported into the HRConnect.
   1. Data in the HRConnect has a higher priority than data in the save file.
3. Save files needs to end with `.csv` in order for the HRConnect to recognise the save file.
4. The csv save file can have at most 1 newline at the end of file for it to be considered valid.
5. If any error is found, **none** of the data in the save file will be imported into the HRConnect.

Format: `import FILEPATH`

Example:<br>
`import C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Desktop\data.csv`

&nbsp;
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Exporting to a csv data file: `export`

Exports all **job applicants** data from the HRConnect into a *csv* save file.

File structure for csv file (tab delimited):

name | phone number | email | address | job position | stage

Notes:
1. Filepath of specified CSV file can be relative or absolute.
2. Specifying the same csv file name and path will overwrite the data inside the specified csv file.
3. Csv file **must** have .csv as a file extension. 
4. If any error is found while executing the command,
**none** of the data from the HRConnect will be exported into the specified csv file.

Format: `export FILEPATH`

Absolute filepath example for WindowsOS: `export C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Desktop\myData.csv` <br>
Relative filepath example for WindowsOS: `export .\myData.csv` <br><br>
Absolute filepath example for MacOS: `export  /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Downloads/myDataFile.csv` <br>
Relative filepath example for MacOS: `export  ./myDataFile.csv`

:exclamation: **Important:** Data in exported csv file will look different depending on the application used to view the
file even though the data is seperated by tabs.
